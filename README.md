This is simply a repository of my Google Data Analytics Professional course and the practice work I have completed.

This course has further developed my fluency in analytical software, especially in SQL as this tool was unheard of for me.

If you feel interested in the realm of data analytics, or if you are simply curious on what this course entails, please have a look!
